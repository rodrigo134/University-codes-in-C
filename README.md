Code 1: This program defines a structure named "product" to store information about each product, including its name, selling price, and available quantity. It prompts the user to enter the number of products they want to add and then collects information for each product individually. After inputting the data, the program identifies the product with the highest selling price and prints its name. It then identifies the product with the largest quantity available in stock and prints its name.
This code provides a simple solution for managing product information and finding products with the highest selling prices and largest quantities in stock.
